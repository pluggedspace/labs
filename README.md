# Pluggedspace Labs

Pluggedspace Labs is the experimental research division of Pluggedspace.

This space exists to explore applied systems in AI, automation, fintech, governance, and security.

Projects in Labs are exploratory by design. They test ideas, validate architectures, and investigate domain-specific intelligence applications.

They are not part of the core **Akili Enterprise Intelligence Platform** unless explicitly stated.

---

## Purpose

Labs serves three objectives:

* Rapid prototyping of applied intelligence systems
* Exploration of domain-specific automation and decision engines
* Incubation of ideas that may integrate into Akili

Labs is not a production environment.
It is a structured research environment.

---

## Project Status Model

Each Labs project is categorized as one of the following:

* **Prototype** — early exploration, unstable APIs
* **Active Research** — under active iteration
* **Stabilized** — technically functional, not core infrastructure
* **Integrated** — absorbed into Akili platform components
* **Archived** — retained for historical reference

This lifecycle ensures clarity and prevents repository sprawl.

## Current Projects


* **[https://github.com/pluggedspace/match]Match Bot** — Machine learning prediction system for football analytics
* **Job Autobot** — Automated job intelligence assistant
* **BorderCash** — Stellar-based multi-currency transaction system
* **Vote** — Blockchain-based governance infrastructure
* **Vulnerability Scanner** — Security analysis tool

Each project maintains its own repository, documentation, and contribution guidelines.

---

## Governance Principles

Labs projects must:

* Have a clearly defined problem domain
* Maintain documented architecture
* Declare dependencies explicitly
* Avoid coupling with Akili’s proprietary intelligence core

Projects that align with Akili’s infrastructure may be refactored and integrated into the platform.

---

## Relationship to Akili

Akili is Pluggedspace’s enterprise intelligence platform.

Labs projects may:

* Act as vertical demonstrations
* Serve as domain-specific experimentation
* Provide integration testbeds

Labs does not expose Akili’s proprietary orchestration, governance, or intelligence infrastructure.

---

## Contribution

External contributors are welcome to explore, test, and extend Labs projects.

Contributions to core infrastructure are managed separately.

---

## Philosophy

Infrastructure requires discipline.
Innovation requires exploration.

Pluggedspace Labs exists to reconcile both.
